In this technical post we cover the technical assets for three near-real-time reporting scenarios with the powerful combination of Databricks and Power BI. 

To gain a deeper understanding of these scenarios, we encourage you to explore the full talk from the [Data and AI Summit 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DcOeqfjPF38). 

The slides of the presentation can be found [here](../RT_with_DB_and_PBI_DAIS23/slides).

# Scenarios Covered

- [Delta Live Tables (DLT) + Power BI Direct Query + Power BI auto page refresh](../RT_with_DB_and_PBI_DAIS23/Scenario1_DLT_DQ)
- [DLT + Power BI Composite models + Power BI page refresh](../RT_with_DB_and_PBI_DAIS23/Scenario2_DLT_Composite)
- [Structured Streaming + Power BI streaming dataset](../RT_with_DB_and_PBI_DAIS23/Scenario3_Structured_Streaming_API)

# Architecture

# Sample Data

For these demonstrations, we utilize sample data directly from or inspired by [Microsoft's AdventureWorks data warehouse](https://github.com/microsoft/sql-server-samples/tree/master/samples/databases/adventure-works). 

Stay tuned as we dive into these scenarios, sharing technical insights, practical examples, and best practices to empower you in leveraging the combined capabilities of Databricks and Power BI for near-real-time reporting and data analytics.
